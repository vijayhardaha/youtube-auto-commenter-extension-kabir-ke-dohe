The YouTube Auto Commenter Extension is a Chrome extension that automates the process of posting a comment and liking YouTube videos. When you click on the extension icon while on a YouTube video page, it randomly picks a "Kabir Ke Dohe" (couplets by Kabir) from a predefined list and posts it, and likes the video.
